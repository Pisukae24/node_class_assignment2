# node_class_assignment2
📝 Project Description (Easy to Understand)
This is a simple Python project that shows how a singly-linked list works using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).

🔹 What it has:
Node class:
Each element in the list is a Node.
It stores some data and a link (next) to the next node.

LinkedList class:
It manages all nodes in the list.
It has methods to:

Add a node at the end:
So we can grow the list.

Print all nodes:
So we can see the whole list nicely.

Delete a node by its index:
So we can remove a specific node.
(The first node is at index 1)

🔹 Exception Handling:
If you try to delete from an empty list, it will raise an Exception.

If you give a bad index (like 0 or greater than the length), it will raise an Exception.
